            Select a safety data metric from the dropdown menu, and this chart will show how that metric's average value has changed over the months. The data is grouped monthly, and a rolling average is applied to smooth out short-term variations, allowing you to spot trends and patterns more easily.
            For example, you can choose metrics like:
            - Transit Vehicle Rider Fatalities
            - People Waiting or Leaving Fatalities
            - Transit Vehicle Operator Fatalities
            - and many more...
            Explore the safety data and uncover insights by changing the selection.
